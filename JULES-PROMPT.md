# Jules Prompts

- Can you convert this project to go?
- Could you also update the README.md file and remove all the other unused files?
- Can you update the project so that only linux is supported, collapse any external dependencies and merge down into a single source file?
- Can you also update the readme to point to the fact this was previously a C application and forked from the upstream and converted by google gemini/jules?
- That looks good, can you also remove the following files/dirs: .github .codeconfig CONTRIBUTING.md _config.yaml
- lets do it
- How would I compile the app and run tests on my own?
- How can I ensure the go binary is statically compiled
- You didnt actually update the readme.md file, can you please ensure the license is retained and the readme properly attributes upstream?
- Can you remove the sponsor link in the readme
- This is great, good to close off
